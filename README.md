# TENDYSTAKEOUT
Forked and changed
special thanks to the ICPSwap team for the source

Beta .10 Tendys take out

token launchpad with the ability to interact and 
hopefully deploy DIP20, EXT, ICRC1 & ICRC2 tokens

many thanks to anybody interested

this is my first software project, and will hopefully bring a fun ui and service to the interner computer. 

some things:
~canisters are set so each peice is its own.
LaunchpadController LaunchpadManager and LaunchpadStorage are all assigned canisters. Launchpad Interface (the front end) also has its own cansiter.

File conventions and paths are left intact but contents have been altered. ui is a work in progress as I am trial by fire learning typescript.
